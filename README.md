Repo for my CCAPDEV Hands-On CSS project

This is my personal biopage website. It includes a main profile page, a contact form, and an academic life page. I built this project to practice and demonstrate my CSS skills.

## Project Pages

- `index.html` – My main profile page, showing my hobbies, interests, and favorite media.
- `contact.html` – A contact form page with different types of inputs.
- `academic.html` – My academic life page with a schedule table and total units.

## Theme

I used a **white and red color theme** throughout the website:

- **Background**: White (#ffffff) to keep everything clean and minimal.
- **Primary color**: Red (#c4161c) for headers, links, borders, and highlights.
- **Secondary color**: Light gray (#f9f9f9 / #f0f0f0) for cards and table rows.

## Styling

- `index.css` – Styling for my main profile page.
- `contact.css` – Styling for my contact form page.
- `academic.css` – Styling for my academic page.
